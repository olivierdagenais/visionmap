# Welcome #
In this project we plan to contribute several of [VisionMap](http://www.visionmap.com)'s internally developed software development productivity tools to the open-source community.

Everybody's welcome to participate by joining the project, performing code reviews, reporting/fixing bugs, contributing code and suggesting new features.


# Projects #
## [CaseTracker](CaseTracker.md) ##

A [FogBugz](http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/) time tracker desktop application, built on top of a C# FogBugz API layer that we developed.

  * CaseTracker hovers on top of your desktop, showing you always on which case you're currently working.

  * Users can start/stop working on a case in FogBugz, which enables up to the second time tracking for cases, which is particularly useful when using [Evidence Based Scheduling](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/10/26.html).

  * It has other cool features as well.

  * (requires [Microsoft .Net Framework 2.0](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5&displaylang=en#Overview,) or newer)

## [Stop, Crop](StopCrop.md) ##

A handy screen-shot snapping utility that allows cropped portions of the screen to be saved in multiple formats as files or to the clipboard.

  * (requires [Microsoft .Net Framework 2.0](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=0856eacb-4362-4b0d-8edd-aab15c5e04f5&displaylang=en#Overview,) or newer)

## [psqlODBC Binaries for Windows 64-bit](psqlODBC.md) ##

The [psqlODBC Drivers](http://pgfoundry.org/projects/psqlodbc/,) for Windows are not distributed pre-built for 64-bit Windows. So we had to build them ourselves.

If you're trying to use PostgreSQL with ODBC on !64-bit Windows, this is what you need to install. ([Download](http://code.google.com/p/visionmap/downloads/list))
